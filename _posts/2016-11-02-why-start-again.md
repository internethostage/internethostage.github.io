Starting a new blog is always an overwhelming and exciting adventure. On one side, you feel you must maintain it, and "this time I will make it work", and on the other side there are feelings of amazing topics to cover and ideas to add.

### Motivations

A lot has changed since my previous blog attempt, I am not sure if I have built one in between but I believe this is the first blog I write since I moved to Canada... and this is possibly my first personal blog post written in english!

Aside from this, starting this blog gives me an excellent opportunity or excuse to test out some "new" (to me) web technologies. Everything from hosting, to blogging systems, css styles, javascript and so on...


### Technologies used so far

This time around I am going for a static blog, generated via Jekyll. Its very quick as it doesn't deal with any heavy backends, and the build process is surprisingly easy to setup. On top of that, at the moment I am trying out [github pages](https://pages.github.com/), a free service offered by github that allows you to transform a repository into a website. Neat!

For theme, I am using a port of an html5, then ported to wordpress, template called ["beetle"](https://github.com/mebezac/beetle-jekyll). This is not an official template neither it is maintained from what I can see, so there was a lot of work involved into fixing, and updating to my setup

On that note, I will get in touch with the original author of the port, to see if I can collaborate to help release this as a more reusable theme. I have a few ideas to improve it and make it more flexible.

### What will the blog talk about?

I am not sure just yet what this blog will focus on, but I will assume it will be a mix of web development, mainly Ruby on Rails, plus ski resort lifestyle, or combinations of both.
