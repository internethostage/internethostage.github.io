Starting a new blog is always an overwhelming and exciting adventure. If you have ever had one before, and for some reason you have abandoned it, you might probably get this "this time I will make it work" spirit mixed with fear. On the other hand there are feelings of extreme creativity, suddenly you have all these amazing topics to cover and ideas to add that might even leave you sleepless once in a while.

The worst for me is to have a great idea just before falling asleep. Constant ideation and planning and sometimes even enough energy to get up and do something about it. I say this is the worst because most of the times, the next day with a clear mind I realize it was not that great of an idea to begin with, or it "doesn't work like this". However, truth be told, some of the best ideas come on this special time between the pillows and dreamland.

### Motivations

A lot has changed since my previous blog attempt, I am not sure if I have built one in between but I believe this is the first personal blog I start since I moved to Canada... and this is possibly my first personal blog post written in english!

Aside from this, starting this blog gives me an excellent opportunity or excuse to test out some "new" (to me) web technologies. Everything from hosting, to blogging systems, css styles, javascript and so on...

### Technologies used so far

This time around I am going for a static blog, generated via [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Its very quick as it doesn't deal with any heavy backends, and the build process is surprisingly easy to setup. Plus its Ruby so yay! On top of that, for the moment I am trying out [github pages](https://pages.github.com/), a free service offered by github that allows you to transform a repository into a website. Neat!

For theme, I am using a port of an html5, then ported to wordpress, template called ["beetle"](https://github.com/mebezac/beetle-jekyll). This is not an "official" template neither it is maintained by the author from what I can see, so there was a lot of work involved into fixing, and updating to my preference.

On that note, I will get in touch with the original author of the port, to see if I can collaborate to help release this as a more reusable theme. I have a few ideas to improve it and make it more flexible.

### What will the blog talk about?

I am not sure just yet what this blog will focus on, but I will assume it will be a mix of web development, mainly Ruby on Rails, plus ski resort lifestyle, or combinations of both.
