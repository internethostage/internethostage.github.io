## About me

Iâ€™m a passionate and dedicated full stack developer and project manager with demonstrated success in designing, implementing, and supporting web applications. <br>


Specializing in Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS, various JavaScript libraries and SQL databases, and with an insatiable thirst to further expand my skill set, I am always seeking for new responsibilities and challenges to further my professional development within the tech industry.
